## How to Use

### Simple Request (No Technical Details Needed!)
```
You: "I want to add tags to expenses so I can organize them better"
     *(Just describe what you want - no technical details)*

→ AI Team works autonomously:
  1. Business Expert analyzes requirements
  2. Data Expert designs data model
  3. UX Designer designs interface
  4. Software Architect plans FSD structure
  5. Senior Engineer implements code
  6. Architect reviews implementation (feedback loop)
  7. QA Engineer tests everything (feedback loop)
  8. All experts do final review (feedback loop)

→ Manager: "✅ Complete!
     - Tags implemented
     - All experts approved
     - 25/25 tests passed
     - Ready for your approval"

→ You: "Ship it!"

→ Documentation Agent: Updates all docs automatically
     - README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
     - API docs, JSDoc comments

→ Manager: "✅ Deployed & Documented!"
```

### Iterative Feedback Process
The engineer doesn't move forward until each expert approves:
- **Architect finds violations** → Engineer fixes → Architect re-reviews
- **QA finds bugs** → Engineer fixes → Architect reviews → QA retests
- **Experts have feedback** → Engineer addresses → Everyone re-reviews

**Result**: High-quality, fully validated features.

### That's It!
No need to:
- ❌ Provide technical specifications
- ❌ Make architectural decisions
- ❌ Write code yourself
- ❌ Test manually
- ❌ Fix architecture issues

Agents do everything autonomously with iterative quality assurance.
