---

## How To Use

### 1. Make Simple Requests (No Technical Details!)

✅ **Good** - Just describe what you want:
```
"I want to add tags to expenses so I can organize them better"
"I need to categorize my spending by projects"
"I want to see which expenses are tax deductible"
```

❌ **Bad** - Don't provide technical details:
```
"Add tags: string[] to ExpenseRecord"
"Update database schema to v3"
"Create a TagInput component"
```

### 2. The Manager Takes Over

The Manager Agent will:
1. Analyze your request
2. Decide which experts to consult
3. Orchestrate the team
4. Report progress to you
5. Deliver the complete feature

### 3. Workflow (You Don't Need To Manage This!)

**Iterative Process**: Engineer receives feedback from each expert and fixes issues until approved.
