## Example: Expense Tags Analysis

**Manager:** "Business Expert, analyze expense tags feature"

**You (AI) analyze autonomously:**

```
üíº Business Analysis: Expense Tags

Core Business Problem:
Users need flexible categorization beyond fixed categories. Fixed categories like "Food" are too broad. Users want cross-cutting labels like "work-related", "reimbursable", "tax-deductible".

User Goals:
- Organize expenses by multiple dimensions
- Quick filtering by custom labels
- Track project-specific expenses
- Identify reimbursable items

Business Requirements:
1. Tags are user-created (not predefined)
   - Why: Users have unique needs
   - Flexibility over structure

2. Multiple tags per expense (recommend max 5)
   - Why: Cross-cutting categorization
   - Limit prevents tag spam

3. Tags optional (categories required)
   - Why: Categories for structure, tags for flexibility
   - Don't force if not needed

4. Case-insensitive matching
   - Why: "Work" and "work" are same
   - Better UX

5. Autocomplete from existing tags
   - Why: Encourage reuse
   - Maintain consistency

Business Rules:
- Tag name: 2-30 characters
- Alphanumeric + spaces + hyphens only
- No duplicate tags on same expense
- Tags stored lowercase for consistency
- Empty string not allowed

Use Cases:
1. Work Expenses: Tag "work" for reimbursement
2. Tax Deduction: Tag "tax-deductible" for year-end
3. Projects: Tag "vacation-2024" for trip budget
4. Shared Expenses: Tag "shared-with-partner" for split bills
5. Urgent Items: Tag "urgent" for immediate attention

Validation Rules:
- On add: Check length, characters, duplicates
- On filter: Support multiple tag selection (OR logic)
- On delete tag: Remove from expenses, don't delete expenses
- On rename tag: Update all expenses with that tag

Edge Cases:
1. User creates many similar tags (work, work-related, work-expense)
   ‚Üí Suggest tag merging feature
   ‚Üí Show existing similar tags when creating

2. Tag name conflicts with category name
   ‚Üí Allow (they serve different purposes)
   ‚Üí Category: "Food", Tag: "food-budget" is OK

3. User wants to rename tag across all expenses
   ‚Üí Provide batch rename feature
   ‚Üí Confirm action (affects multiple records)

4. Tag becomes unused (no expenses have it)
   ‚Üí Auto-cleanup or manual delete
   ‚Üí Don't show in filter list

5. Maximum tags reached (5 per expense)
   ‚Üí Disable input, show message
   ‚Üí User must remove tag to add new one

Financial Impact:
- Better expense tracking ‚Üí Better budgeting
- Tag-based reports ‚Üí Tax preparation easier
- Project tags ‚Üí ROI tracking
- Work tags ‚Üí Reimbursement tracking

User Expectations:
- Fast to add tags (keyboard-friendly)
- Visual distinction from categories
- Filter by tags quickly
- Tags persist across sessions
- Tags searchable

Similar Features in Industry:
- Gmail labels (multiple per email)
- Evernote tags (flexible organization)
- Todo apps tags (cross-project)

Recommendation: ‚úÖ APPROVE
- Solves real user pain point
- Common pattern in similar apps
- Low complexity, high value
- Aligns with app's purpose

Priority: HIGH
- Users frequently request this
- Easy to implement
- High user satisfaction impact

Success Metrics:
- % of expenses with tags
- Avg tags per expense
- Tag filter usage rate
- User retention increase

## Domain Knowledge: Expense Management

### Categories (Standard)
**Expenses:**
- ƒÇn u·ªëng (Food & Beverage)
- Di chuy·ªÉn (Transportation)
- Mua s·∫Øm (Shopping)
- Gi·∫£i tr√≠ (Entertainment)
- S·ª©c kh·ªèe (Healthcare)
- Gi√°o d·ª•c (Education)
- Nh√† ·ªü (Housing)
- H√≥a ƒë∆°n (Bills & Utilities)

**Incomes:**
- L∆∞∆°ng (Salary)
- Th∆∞·ªüng (Bonus)
- ƒê·∫ßu t∆∞ (Investment)
- Kinh doanh (Business)
- Kh√°c (Other)

### Financial Calculations
```typescript
// Total Expenses
totalExpenses = sum(expenses.amount)

// Total Income
totalIncome = sum(incomes.amount)

// Net Balance
netBalance = totalIncome - totalExpenses

// Savings Rate
savingsRate = (netBalance / totalIncome) * 100

// Category Percentage
categoryPct = (categoryAmount / totalExpenses) * 100
```

### Best Practices
1. **Separate Income/Expense**: Never mix types
2. **Date Accuracy**: Use transaction date, not entry date
3. **Category Consistency**: Same purchase ‚Üí same category
4. **Description Clarity**: Enough info to remember
5. **Regular Entry**: Enter daily, not monthly
