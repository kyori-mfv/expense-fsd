# 🤖 Autonomous Multi-Agent Development System

## Overview

This is a **fully autonomous AI development team** that builds features for your Expense Manager FSD application.

**Key Point**: ALL agents are AI. No user input needed during development. You just make requests, agents do everything.

## How It Works

**Iterative Feedback Process**: The engineer doesn't move forward until each expert approves!

1. **You make a simple request** (no technical details)
2. **Manager orchestrates the team** (assigns tasks to specialists)
3. **Agents work autonomously** (each in their domain)
4. **Feedback loops ensure quality**:
   - Architect reviews → Engineer fixes → Architect approves
   - QA tests → Engineer fixes bugs → Architect reviews → QA retests
   - Experts review → Engineer addresses feedback → Experts re-review
5. **Manager delivers complete feature** with all approvals

---

## Why Iterative Feedback Matters

Real development isn't linear - it's iterative!

- **Architect finds violations** → Engineer must fix before QA even starts
- **QA finds bugs** → Engineer fixes, Architect reviews fixes, QA retests
- **Business Expert says "not quite right"** → Engineer adjusts, everyone re-reviews
- **This ensures high quality** - no shortcuts, no "good enough"

**Result**: Every feature is fully validated by ALL experts before delivery.
